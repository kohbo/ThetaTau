			<h2>Theta Tau Gulf Regionals Sponsorship Information</h2>
			<h3>Letter from Event Coordinator</h3>
			<p>
			Since its early origin in 2008, the FIU Chapter of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity has developed and fostered engineers of all disciplines with strong communication, problem-solving, collaboration, and leadership skills of which we demonstrate in our profession and community. Currently, as a Chapter, we are forty-seven active members strong and have members who have internships or who have graduated and work in top companies such as Boeing, Chrysler, GM,Verizon Terremark, IBM, Florida Power and Light and others.  Skills for working at these companies were wrought from a balance of education, networking, and professional activities obtained through Theta Tau.</p> 
			<p>
			Last year our Chapter, the Theta Tau FIU Chapter, Omega Gamma, was given the honor and privilege to host Theta Tau's first Annual Gulf Regional Conference 2014. This great collaboration will unite several Chapters across Florida which include Florida International University, University of Florida, University of South Florida, University of Central Florida, Florida State University, and Florida Gulf Coast University for a weekend in the city of Miami.
			</p><p>
			The Regional Conference is a three day event begining Friday, February 21, through Sunday February 23.  This event is key for many of the members in the Chapter, for they will be networking nationally with other members, some who work in the top companies of the world.  Not only will they forge connections, but it will be an excellent learning experience listening to various lectures that touch upon the subjects of ethics, globalization, and how to land your dream job.  This event will be beneficial for it will give our members numerous skills and connections which will be applied to their engineering careers.
			</p><p>
			We understand that companies are limited to tight budgets in the current economic climate, but any contribution to our organization, Theta Tau Omega Gamma is extremely helpful. We greatly appreciate our sponsors' interests in helping our organization. Companies that value our goals empower undergraduate engineers to suceed and advance in their career and future endeavours. Sponsoring this event is a great opportunity to market your company to engineering students of all disciplines from five universities across the state of Florida. 
			</p><p>
			Attached to this packet is our organization's achievements throughtout the years displaying how we have influenced our school and community. The last page displays sponsorship plans that we are offering. However, we will be happy to discuss other options that may better suit your needs.
			</p><p>
			We look forward to collaborating with your company during this event and in the future.
