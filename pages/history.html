                    On November 8, 2008, eleven extremely enthusiastic students were colonized as the Florida International University Colony of Theta Tau. This colonization was the culmination of their hard work, dedication, and passion.  Before this date, with the help of their advisor Walter Maldonado, the eleven founding fathers organized themselves accordingly to be able to lay the foundation for establishing a committed, strong, and thriving organization. Soon after being acknowledged by Nationals as a Colony, the Founding Fathers began preparations for their first Rush period, which lead to the Alpha class in spring of 2009.The induction of the Alpha Class on May 30th, 2009 marked the first successful pledge process for the young colony. This was a monumental achievement by the colony which allowed eleven new brothers to join the fraternity increasing the colonies total membership to twenty-two brothers. The newly inducted brothers from the Alpha Class brought with them enthusiasm and a sense of determination that would propel the colony for the events that followed in the summer.

The colony now composed of the Founding Fathers and Alpha Class took the initiative to become active in the community in numerous positive ways. The summer semester allowed the colony to participate in its first Habitat for Humanity, as well as the colony's most known project to date, the College of Engineering and Computing Central Park Beautification. The Beautification project took place near the college's prized Solar Decathlon house, hoping to inspire a symbol for scholarly exchange and discussion for a more eco-friendly environment. The colony spent the summer fundraising and collecting donations to fill the park with native plants, adding to the development of a Green campus and the diversification of our South Florida habitat. The remodeling of the park finally provided students and faculty with a sense of community and school spirit, a feeling that had been absent in the college for quite some time. </p><br /><p class="defaultText textColor01">
The fall semester of 2009 resulted in many new milestones for the Colony, the first of which was the colony's one year anniversary in November and its first elected executive board. The fall was a time period that allowed the Colony to expand and develop our professional aspect by providing the brothers with numerous speakers and engineering related resources such as resume workshops, Robert Rules of Order and attending the HENAAC national conference in California. The Beta Class was formally inducted into the colony ending their pledge process in January 9th, 2010, almost doubling the membership of the colony. Beta Class provided the Colony with a young group of brothers whose close bond with each other will add to the legacy created by the Founding Fathers and the Alpha Class. The Colony with the addition of the Beta Class was able to head into the spring semester with the passion and man power to maximize our potential. The Colony was able to take on community service events such as Relay for Life and attend its second Habitat for Humanity philanthropy by the time of the Theta Tau FIU Colony's third rush, the Colony was gaining recognition from the engineering community on campus. The Colony had been established for over a year at the inception of the Gamma Class rush and was prepared to start the year by having its most successful rush to date. Gamma Class is the product of careful preparation and dedication by the brothers of the Colony in hopes of producing the Colony's best class yet. The pledges, full of potential have already began to show the skills and brotherhood needed in order to become a successful member of our beloved Fraternity. The Colony is eager for the induction of the Gamma Class to join the brotherhood that is the Theta Tau FIU Colony.
